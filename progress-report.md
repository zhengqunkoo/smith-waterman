# Progress Report

## What we have done
- Implemented sequential algorithm
- Provided input files
- Gave example usage commands

## What will be done
- Implement basic Rognes impementation
- Implement SWAT optimazation for vertical vector alignment
- Parallize using either multithreaded diagonal-vector synchronization or implement boolean synchronzation matrix for H-matrix sections
- Determine whether backtracking should be saved for each cell (memory cost) vs. calculating at runtime (cpu cost)
